# hello-world

My first repository
23/11/2021. the day I decide to make some changes in my life. I wanna step out the comfort zone and make my hands dirty by doing some real projects.
There are three things I am going to do.

1. Github account. I'm going to try to do some projects and share some interesting projects i find here. My Github account will be the place where those potential recruiters can find my beauty.hehe
2. Linkin. To land my first web developer job sucessfully, Linkin might be the best place to find new people and opportunities. Be cheecky and try to make some connections.
3. Portfolio. It's partially done, some features should be implemented, such as the contact and project demo.

For a better me. #Day1
